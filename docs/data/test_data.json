Sacramento Daily Union, 21 November 1859. Racialized content: engage this history with respect and care. GB.1859.1 was an adult Grizzly Bear of unknown sex killed by two hunters near Bear Mountain and the fresh water Calaveras River system in San Andreas, California, United States on or about 18 November, 1859. The story first appeared in the Sacramento Daily Union on 21 November, 1859 and circulated to other California newspapers in various forms from 23 November, 1859 to 6 January, 1860. GB.1859.1’s microhistory represents a hunt motivated by or resulting in human consumption of predator animals and involves the sale of meat as well as body parts. Weight data from the sale of meat suggests a meat weight over 600lbs (271kg). The sale of GB.1859.1’s “gall,” or gallbladder, to a Chinese American community is also significant. Racialized, sensationalized commentary on this sale contribute to the visibility of GB.1859.1’s microhistory in Californian newspapers. This microhistory takes place on or involves the Ancestral Lands of the Miwok (Miwuk, Mi-Wuk, Me-Wuk) People of California, including the Central Sierra Miwok and the Northern Sierra Miwok (Me-Wuk). As an encounter which describes an animal’s death, this Bear has been assigned a Unique Animal Number (UAN) of GB.1859.1. This Bear’s history represents an encounter which impacts one or more predator agency physically, and is so classed as a Tier 1 event.

T.GB.1859.1 is a Tracks entry which refers to the sighting and historical presence of grizzly bears on and around Bear Mountain and the Calaveras River system in San Andreas, California, United States, on or about the 16th of November, 1859. This microhistory appears in an article published in the California newspapers the San Andreas Independent (19 November, 1859) and San Joaquin Republican. It describes multiple human actors in proximity to a community of grizzlies in late autumn during their seasonal transition from hyperphagia to the “predenning” or denning behaviours of autumn which precede the winter rest period which continues throughout the subsequent winter. This microhistory describes relationships between meteorological and climatological shifts affect seasonal animal movement, refers to the presence of relevant prey species, and includes its details pertaining to den site features relevant to historicizing Grizzly populations. Evident intersections with extractive industries, including mining, prospecting, and water management divulge the presence of associated infrastructure and settlement contributive to habitat fragmentation. Its reference to the prospecting activities of Mark McNicholas may offer context to the history of GB.1859.1, a Grizzly killed in the same location at the same time, but whose fatality is not referred to in the San Joaquin Republican’s reprint of the original San Andreas Independent article. This microhistory takes place on or involves the Ancestral Lands of the Miwok (Miwuk, Mi-Wuk, Me-Wuk) People of California, including the Central Sierra Miwok and the Northern Sierra Miwok (Me-Wuk). This Bear’s history represents an encounter with a predator animal with no physical contact regardless of proximity and is so classed as a Tier 2 event.

Racialized content: engage this history with respect and care. T.GB.1859.2 is a Tracks entry which refers to the presence of multiple active grizzly den sites on and around Bear Mountain and the involved Calaveras River system on or about the 23rd of November, 1859. It positions these den sites at a midway point between Salt Spring Valley, a mining settlement and San Andreas, California in the United States associated with predominantly-French settlement near the Bear Mountain Range in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. It interlinks with the primary source bases of both T.GB.1859.1 and GB.1859.1, an adult Grizzly Bear killed on or about 18 November,1859 which correspond to the racialized, sensationalized distribution of GB.1859.1’s connections to the Chinese-American community. The wide distribution of GB.1859.1’s microhistory divulged further details pertaining to the historical ecology of Bear Mountain and the presence of other hunters “enjoying a rich harvest of sport” near Salt Spring Valley and San Andreas, and indeed, divulged the specific location of a predator community to a significant audience of potential hunters. T.GB.1859.2 provides evidence for the continued presence of den sites in this location beyond the bounds of GB.1859.1’s microhistory, and notes the existence of den sites at an additional position between Salt Spring Valley and San Andreas. It historicizes den site selection in Grizzly populations and contextualizes relational aspects of climate history and the agency of weather in shaping predator and environmental microhistories of Northern California. It offers primary source account of responsive animal movement amid climatological fluctuations, historicizes the presence of prey species (such as deer and “large game”) in close proximity to American settlement, and describes the historical presence of wild animal and plant populations of the Calaveras River and the Sierra Nevada Mountains, including chaparral, signaling the historical presence of a keystone plant population. It contextualizes the presence of mining and prospecting industries, their associated infrastructure and labourers and places multiple human actors, social groups, and extractive industries in proximity to grizzly communities displaying “predenning” or denning behaviours typical of autumn, late autumn and early winter which precede the winter rest period. The prospecting activities of Mark McNicholas on Bear mountain, as well as the water infrastructure and management operations of the Calaveras Water Company may offer further context to this history. The proximity of this predator community to extractive activities and settlement can be read in dialogue with other predator populations subject to habitat inaccessibility or fragmentation on overall population health and reproductive outcomes. This microhistory is descriptive of an event which regards “sign” of a predator population or individual, but in which no visual record or physical encounter occurs, and is so classed as a Tier 3 event.

We clip the following items of news from the Plumas Standard of the 14th: Disagreeable Encounter. — As Mr. Shick, of this place, was returning from the O’Hara claims on the hill back of town, on yesterday, he encountered a large bear, which he thinks must have been a grizzly. When within about a mile of Quincy, Mr. S. Lost his way, and endeavoring to find the trail, he came across some tracks which he supposed would lead to it, following which he came to a clump of bushes from which emerged the bear. Rearing, at the sight of our hero, upon his hind legs, as if for a friendly greeting, whereupon Shick drew his pocket-knife, determined to make his best fight.

Mr. Moore was attacked and pretty roughly handled by his cubship, and had not one of the party released his grip by a rifle ball, he would have breathed his last in young bruin’s embrace ; as it was, he came off with a badly mangled thumb and fingers, and a few minor wounds. Jeff Hickman crippled the old bear, but in the excitement of relieving their companion, and killing grizzly junior, grizzly senior sagaciously placed a safe distance between herself and danger, thus saving her hide and tallow for another occasion. Our informant says it was the roughest squabble he ever participated in.” The UANs T.GB.1860.2 and GB.1860.2A have been assigned to this microhistory.

Mr. Moore was attacked and pretty roughly handled by his cubship, and had not one of the party released his grip by a rifle ball, he would have breathed his last in young bruin’s embrace ; as it was, he came off with a badly mangled thumb and fingers, and a few minor wounds. Jeff Hickman crippled the old bear, but in the excitement of relieving their companion, and killing grizzly junior, grizzly senior sagaciously placed a safe distance between herself and danger, thus saving her hide and tallow for another occasion. Our informant says it was the roughest squabble he ever participated in.” The UANs T.GB.1860.2 and GB.1860.2A have been assigned to this microhistory.
