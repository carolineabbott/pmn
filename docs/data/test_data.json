          "value": "A large grizzly was killed near Bear mountain a few days since, and but a short distance from San Andreas. News of the Morning, Grizzly Killed. Sacramento Daily Union, 21 November 1859, Volume 18, Number 2699. GB.1859.1 was a large, adult Grizzly Bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) of unknown sex killed on Bear Mountain or the Bear or Hogback Mountains approximately three miles San Andreas, California by a party of two unnamed hunters on or about 18 November, 1859. Five additional print media articles provide fuller context on this microhistory, all of which can be accessed via the California Digital Newspaper Collection (CDNC).It is likely that GB.1859.1 weighed over one thousand pounds when slaughtered for meat and gallbladder, adding credence to the inference that this Bear was likely an adult in fair or good health at the time of its death. The killing of GB.1859.1 and the sale of GB.1859.1's meat was notable to the Californian press both for its size and for the sale of Bear Gall or gallbladder to unnamed members of the Chinese community (likely emigrants and labourers) in an unnamed location, likely, Calaveras County or San Francisco. GB.1859.1's microhistory should be considered in conjunction with the history of the California Grizzly, a now-extirpated population local to this region at this time. GB.1859.1 was killed during the Winter Rest Period, or torpor sleep period colloquially referred to as “hibernation,” and adjacent sources (see TR.1859.1) refer to the presence of Grizzly dens in this area, as well as to mining prospectors (among them, Mark McNicholas). GB.1859.1 lived on the Territories of the Miwok (Miwuk; Mi-Wuk; Me-Wuk) People, and may have been denning in a nearby gulch. The identities of the two hunters are not presently known. It is likely that snowfall in the mountains made the tracking of GB.1859.1 more feasible, and noted that a mild winter contributed to the presence of wild ruminants at lower elevations adjacent to town than typical for the season (the implication being that bears often followed).

GB.1859.3 was a large, likely adult male Grizzly Bear of unknown weight or length. GB.1859.3 was shot and killed under unknown circumstances on Tuesday, 8 November 1859 on the outskirts of Oakland, California within the plausible bounds of the Winter Rest Period or “Hibernation,” and the factors which resulted in this bear’s death or motivation for its killing are unknown. The status of GB.1859.3’s health upon his death is unknown from available resources, but basis exists to consider that the overall condition of this Bear may plausibly be presumed to have been good: GB.1859.3’s carcass was brought to San Francisco and sold, likely, for meat. It is likely that GB.1859.3 was killed by settlers, and given regional history, it is possible that GB.1859.3’s killing involved the ranching or forestry industries. GB.1859.3’s story appears in two print sources specific to California, both of which can be accessed through the California Digital Newspaper Collection (CDNC). Available geolocational context in these microhistories suggest that GB.1859.3’s killing is likely to have occurred on the land of one or more of the following Indigenous Communities: the Ohlone Peoples, the Muwékma Ohlone Tribe, the Miwok, the Me-Wuk (Bay Miwok), and the Confederated Villages of Lisjan. The timing and location of GB.1859.3’s microhistory suggests the possibility that this Bear’s history should be considered in the context of the history of the California Grizzly, a subspecies considered extinct. GB.1859.3’s microhistory reveals the history of another Bear, also stated to be a Grizzly, GB.1859.3A. Based on context within these narratives and historical maps including the United States Coast Survey map of San Antonio Creek, a representative, approximate location for this microhistory has been set to coordinates within Snow Park, a public park in Oakland, California.

This is the second grizzly killed lately, whilst prowling the vicinity of a civilized community.” GB.1859.3A was a large, likely adult male Grizzly Bear measuring over six feet in length shot and killed on 12 November 1859 on the outskirts of Oakland, California during the Winter Rest Period (Hibernation), likely, by settler groups. The timing and location of GB.1859.3A’s microhistory suggests that this Bear’s history should be considered in the context of the California Grizzly, a subspecies now considered extinct. The factors which resulted in this Bear's death or which preceded its killing are unknown, but there is strong basis to consider proximity or habituation to settlers as a potential catalyst for human retaliation based on primary source material. Importantly, GB.1859.3A’s microhistory is entangled with the history of another Bear, also stated to be a Grizzly, GB.1859.3, killed four days prior in the same place. Given regional history of Oakland, California, both GB.1859.3 and GB.1859.3A’s killings should be considered in the context of ranching, milling, mining, and forestry industries. Critically, the presence of these microhistories in geolocational and chronological context lays bare connections between extractivist, nineteenth century industries such as mining and milling and predator history. These entanglements describe a relationship which should be considered a prevalent factor in driving increased, violent settler-Bear entanglement at this time in California’s history. The status of GB.1859.3A's health upon death is unknown. Available geolocational context in these microhistories suggest that GB.1859.3A’s killing is likely to have occurred on the land of one or more of the following Indigenous Communities: the Ohlone Peoples, the Muwékma Ohlone Tribe, the Miwok, the Me-Wuk (Bay Miwok), and the Confederated Villages of Lisjan.

GB.1859.2A was an adult female Grizzly Bear shot with her two cubs (GB.1859.2B and GB.1859.2C, whose sexes and developmental stage or age are unknown) near San Jose, California prior to 28 November 1859. GB.1859.2A weighed 400lbs. GB.1859.2A, GB.1859.2B and GB.1859.2C were brought to San Francisco after being killed. It is likely their meat was sold at the San Francisco meat market. A date of 28 November 1859 has been retained for this history as a more specific date cannot be determined at this time, but it is likely that GB.1859.2A and cubs were up to a fortnight prior to the publication of this report in the Union, and was likely killed in mid-November of 1859. The sale of Grizzly meat was still common in San Francisco at this time. It is not known whether GB.1859.2A and cubs were deliberately hunted for profit or consumption, or whether they were killed for predation or as a result of habituation. Available geolocational context in this microhistory suggest that GB.1859.2A’s killing is likely to have occurred on the land of one or more of the following Indigenous Communities: Tamien Nation, Muwekma, and Ohlone Peoples. The timing and location of GB.1859.2A’s microhistory suggests the possibility that this Bear’s history should be considered in the context of the history of the California Grizzly, a subspecies considered extinct. Due to limited context for GB.1859.2A, GB.1859.2B, and GB.1859.2C, the specific location at which this microhistory took place is presently unknown. St. James Park has been selected as a representative location for this microhistory due to its proximity to other historic sites within the town’s nineteenth century footprint, and its establishment (originally as St. James’s Square) in 1848. It is likely GB.1859.2A and cubs were shot in the hills to the east of San Jose.

GB.1859.2A was an adult female Grizzly Bear shot with her two cubs (GB.1859.2B and GB.1859.2C, whose sexes and developmental stage or age are unknown) near San Jose, California prior to 28 November 1859. GB.1859.2A weighed 400lbs. Size, sex, and more specific age details pertaining to GB.1859.2B and GB.1859.2C are not known. GB.1859.2A, GB.1859.2B and GB.1859.2C were brought to San Francisco after being killed. It is likely their meat was sold at the San Francisco meat market. A date of 28 November 1859 has been retained for this history as a more specific date cannot be determined at this time, but it is likely that GB.1859.2A and cubs were up to a fortnight prior to the publication of this report in the Union, likely in mid-November of 1859. The sale of Grizzly meat was still common in San Francisco at this time. It is not known whether GB.1859.2A and cubs were deliberately hunted for profit or consumption, or whether they were killed for predation or as a result of habituation. Available geolocational context in this microhistory suggest that GB.1859.2A, GB.1859.2B, and GB.1859.2C’s killings are likely to have occurred on the land of one or more of the following Indigenous Communities: Tamien Nation, Muwekma, and Ohlone Peoples. The timing and location of GB.1859.2A’s microhistory suggests the possibility that this Bear’s history should be considered in the context of the history of the California Grizzly, a subspecies considered extinct. Due to limited context for GB.1859.2A, GB.1859.2B, and GB.1859.2C, the specific location at which this microhistory took place is presently unknown. St. James Park has been selected as a representative location for this microhistory due to its proximity to other historic sites within the town’s nineteenth century footprint, and its establishment (originally as St. James’s Square) in 1848. It is likely GB.1859.2A and cubs were shot in the hills to the east of San Jose.

Lost his way, and endeavoring to find the trail, he came across some tracks which he supposed would lead to it, following which he came to a clump of bushes from which emerged the bear. Rearing, at the sight of our hero, upon his hind legs, as if for a friendly greeting, whereupon Shick drew his pocket-knife, determined to make his best fight. Bruin, however, declined any further contest, and Shick, greatly relieved, south tracks in a different direction. It is fortunate that he escaped so readily. Once the above was written, our “Nimrods” who, immediately started on receipt of the intelligence, after the bear, have returned, bringing with them, as a trophy, the dead carcass of the venerable bruin with two of his progeny who were alive and kicking, and we might add, scratching, also.” The UANs GB.1860.1, GB.1860.1A, GB.1860.1B have been assigned to this microhistory. GB.1860.1B was one of two cubs taken captive by hunters. This microhistory can be accessed through the California Digital Newspaper Collection (CDNC). Available geolocational context in these microhistories suggest that GB.1860.1B’s killing is likely to have occurred on the land of one or more of the following Indigenous Communities: the Mountain Maidu. Please see the Predator Microhistory Network's entry for GB.1860.1, GB.1860.1A, GB.1860.1B for full context, and citations."
