          "value": "A large grizzly was killed near Bear mountain a few days since, and but a short distance from San Andreas. News of the Morning, Grizzly Killed. Sacramento Daily Union, 21 November 1859, Volume 18, Number 2699. GB.1859.1 was a large, adult Grizzly Bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) of unknown sex killed on Bear Mountain or the Bear or Hogback Mountains approximately three miles San Andreas, California by a party of two unnamed hunters on or about 18 November, 1859. Five additional print media articles provide fuller context on this microhistory, all of which can be accessed via the California Digital Newspaper Collection (CDNC).It is likely that GB.1859.1 weighed over one thousand pounds when slaughtered for meat and gallbladder, adding credence to the inference that this Bear was likely an adult in fair or good health at the time of its death. The killing of GB.1859.1 and the sale of GB.1859.1's meat was notable to the Californian press both for its size and for the sale of Bear Gall or gallbladder to unnamed members of the Chinese community (likely emigrants and labourers) in an unnamed location, likely, Calaveras County or San Francisco. GB.1859.1's microhistory should be considered in conjunction with the history of the California Grizzly, a now-extirpated population local to this region at this time. GB.1859.1 was killed during the Winter Rest Period, or torpor sleep period colloquially referred to as “hibernation,” and adjacent sources (see TR.1859.1) refer to the presence of Grizzly dens in this area, as well as to mining prospectors (among them, Mark McNicholas). GB.1859.1 lived on the Territories of the Miwok (Miwuk; Mi-Wuk; Me-Wuk) People, and may have been denning in a nearby gulch. The identities of the two hunters are not presently known. It is likely that snowfall in the mountains made the tracking of GB.1859.1 more feasible, and noted that a mild winter contributed to the presence of wild ruminants at lower elevations adjacent to town than typical for the season (the implication being that bears often followed).

We clip the following items of news from the Plumas Standard of the 14th: Disagreeable Encounter. As Mr. Shick, of this place, was returning from the O’Hara claims on the hill back of town, on yesterday, he encountered a large bear, which he thinks must have been a grizzly. When within about a mile of Quincy, Mr. S. Lost his way, and endeavoring to find the trail, he came across some tracks which he supposed would lead to it, following which he came to a clump of bushes from which emerged the bear. Rearing, at the sight of our hero, upon his hind legs, as if for a friendly greeting, whereupon Shick drew his pocket-knife, determined to make his best fight. Bruin, however, declined any further contest, and Shick, greatly relieved, south tracks in a different direction. It is fortunate that he escaped so readily. Once the above was written, our “Nimrods” who, immediately started on receipt of the intelligence, after the bear, have returned, bringing with them, as a trophy, the dead carcass of the venerable bruin with two of his progeny who were alive and kicking, and we might add, scratching, also.” The UANs GB.1860.1, GB.1860.1A, GB.1860.1B have been assigned to this microhistory. GB.1860.1B was one of two cubs taken captive by hunters. This microhistory can be accessed through the California Digital Newspaper Collection (CDNC). Available geolocational context in these microhistories suggest that GB.1860.1B’s killing is likely to have occurred on the land of one or more of the following Indigenous Communities: the Mountain Maidu. Please see the Predator Microhistory Network's entry for GB.1860.1, GB.1860.1A, GB.1860.1B for full context, and citations."

Mr. Moore was attacked and pretty roughly handled by his cubship, and had not one of the party released his grip by a rifle ball, he would have breathed his last in young bruin’s embrace ; as it was, he came off with a badly mangled thumb and fingers, and a few minor wounds. Jeff Hickman crippled the old bear, but in the excitement of relieving their companion, and killing grizzly junior, grizzly senior sagaciously placed a safe distance between herself and danger, thus saving her hide and tallow for another occasion. Our informant says it was the roughest squabble he ever participated in.” The UANs T.GB.1860.2 and GB.1860.2A have been assigned to this microhistory.
